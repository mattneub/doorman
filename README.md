# Doorman

## Password Generator

Doorman is a password generator that generates safe random passwords. Please see the original, <http://mr-fridge.de/software/doorman>.

[This fork is a modernization. The Favorites drawer has been removed, along with other deprecated material, and the language has been converted to Swift. The code compiles against the macOS 11 SDK without warnings. Additional cleanup and new features will probably follow eventually.]

## Features

#### Random Passwords
For your random passwords you can precisely define the length and the characters that should be used.

#### Speakable Password
Doorman can generate random passwords that resemble natural words. This lets you create safe passwords that are still easy to remember. [This feature does not work very well, and one goal of this fork will be to improve it.]
	
#### Favorites
While looking for the optimal password, you can keep the best candidates in the favorites list.
Of course your favorites are not saved to disk and cannot be retrieved by third parties. [This feature was removed during modernization.]

#### Password Safety
To be sure that your password is safe enough, Doorman has a scale, which displays the safety of your password.
